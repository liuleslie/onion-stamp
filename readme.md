# internet onion â€” stamped!

below from Laurel Schwulst's [original repo](https://github.com/laurelschwulst/internet-onion)

---

the site is published through github pages at the custom domain:<br>
https://the-life-and-death-of-an-internet-onion.com

the published folder is `docs/`

you can see past versions in the `past-versions/` folder

this site is made with mostly static html, css, and javascript!

the only thing to note:

we use sass though, so make sure to install sass, go into the `css/` folder, and run:

```
sass --watch style.sass style.css
```

thanks for contributing!
